 * Class for generating a sequence of deterministic GUID values.
 * NOTE: This is a quick hack, and does not generate valid UUIDs.
 * To generate a deterministic sequence of values that are also valid
 * UUIDs, we must employ the "Name-based UUID" method described in
 * RFC 4122 ยง4.3 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt), which is
 * supported by Node's 'uuid/v3' module.
